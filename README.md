## Introduction

`immunarch` is an R package designed to analyse T-cell receptor (TCR) and B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoires, mainly tailored to medical scientists and bioinformaticians. The mission of `immunarch` is to make immune sequencing data analysis as effortless as possible and help you focus on research instead of coding.


## Contact
Create a ticket with a bug or question on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/immunomind/immunarch/issues) to get help from the community and enrich it with your experience. If you need to send us sensitive data, feel free to contact us via [support@immunomind.io](mailto:support@immunomind.io).


## Installation

### Latest release on CRAN
In order to install `immunarch` execute the following command:

```r
install.packages("immunarch")
```

That's it, you can start using `immunarch` now! See the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section below to dive into immune repertoire data analysis. If you run in any trouble during installation, take a look at the [Installation Troubleshooting](https://immunarch.com/articles/v1_introduction.html#installation-troubleshooting) section.

Note: there are quite a lot of dependencies to install with the package because it installs all the widely-used packages for data analysis and visualisation. You got both the AIRR data analysis framework and the full Data Science package ecosystem with only one command, making `immunarch` the entry-point for single-cell & immune repertoire Data Science.


### Latest release on GitHub
If the above command doesn't work for any reason, try installing `immunarch` directly from its repository:

```r
install.packages(c("devtools", "pkgload")) # skip this if you already installed these packages
devtools::install_github("immunomind/immunarch")
devtools::reload(pkgload::inst("immunarch"))
```


### Latest pre-release on GitHub
Since releasing on CRAN is limited to one release per one or two months, you can install the latest pre-release version with all the bleeding edge and optimised features directly from the code repository. In order to install the latest pre-release version, you need to execute the following commands:

```r
install.packages(c("devtools", "pkgload")) # skip this if you already installed these packages
devtools::install_github("immunomind/immunarch", ref="dev")
devtools::reload(pkgload::inst("immunarch"))
```

You can find the list of releases of `immunarch` here: https://github.com/immunomind/immunarch/releases


## Key Features

1. Data agnostic. Fast and easy manipulation of immune repertoire data:

    + The package automatically detects the format of your files---no more guessing what format is *that* file, just pass them to the package;
  
    + Supports all popular TCR and BCR analysis and post-analysis formats, including single-cell data: [ImmunoSEQ](https://www.immunoseq.com/), [IMGT](https://www.imgt.org/IMGTindex/IMGTHighV-QUEST.php), [MiTCR](https://github.com/milaboratory/mitcr), [MiXCR](https://github.com/milaboratory/mixcr), [MiGEC](https://github.com/mikessh/migec), [MigMap](https://github.com/mikessh/migmap), [VDJtools](https://github.com/mikessh/vdjtools), [tcR](https://github.com/imminfo/tcr), [AIRR](http://docs.airr-community.org/en/latest/), [10XGenomics](https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets?menu%5Bproducts.name%5D=Single+Cell+Immune+Profiling), ArcherDX. More coming in the future;

    + Works on any data source you are comfortable with: R data frames, data tables from [data.table](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/), databases like [MonetDB](https://github.com/MonetDB), Apache Spark data frames via [sparklyr](https://spark.rstudio.com/);
    
    + Tutorial is available [here](https://immunarch.com/articles/v2_data.html).

2. Beginner-friendly. Immune repertoire analysis made simple:

    + Most methods are incorporated in a couple of main functions with clear naming---no more remembering dozens and dozens of functions with obscure names. For details see [link](https://immunarch.com/articles/web_only/v3_basic_analysis.html);

    + Repertoire overlap analysis *(common indices including overlap coefficient, Jaccard index and Morisita's overlap index)*. Tutorial is available [here](https://immunarch.com/articles/web_only/v4_overlap.html);
  
    + Gene usage estimation *(correlation, Jensen-Shannon Divergence, clustering)*. Tutorial is available [here](https://immunarch.com/articles/web_only/v5_gene_usage.html);

    + Diversity evaluation *(ecological diversity index, Gini index, inverse Simpson index, rarefaction analysis)*. Tutorial is available [here](https://immunarch.com/articles/web_only/v6_diversity.html);

    + Tracking of clonotypes across time points, widely used in vaccination and cancer immunology domains. Tutorial is available [here](https://immunarch.com/articles/web_only/v8_tracking.html);
    
    + K-mer distribution measures and statistics. Tutorial is available [here](https://immunarch.com/articles/web_only/v9_kmers.html);
    
    + Coming in the next releases: CDR3 amino acid physical and chemical properties assessment, mutation networks.

3. Seamless publication-ready plots with a built-in tool for visualisation manipulation: 

    + Rich visualisation procedures with [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/);
  
    + Built-in tool `FixVis` makes your plots publication-ready: easily change font sizes, text angles, titles, legends and many more with clear-cut GUI;
    
    + Tutorial is available [here](https://immunarch.com/articles/web_only/v7_fixvis.html).
    
    
## Quick start
The gist of the typical TCR or BCR data analysis workflow can be reduced to the next few lines of code.

### Use `immunarch` data

**1) Load the package and the data**

```r
library(immunarch)  # Load the package into R
data(immdata)  # Load the test dataset
```

**2) Calculate and visualise basic statistics**

```r
repExplore(immdata$data, "lens") %>% vis()  # Visualise the length distribution of CDR3
repClonality(immdata$data, "homeo") %>% vis()  # Visualise the relative abundance of clonotypes
```

**3) Explore and compare T-cell and B-cell repertoires**
```r
repOverlap(immdata$data) %>% vis()  # Build the heatmap of public clonotypes shared between repertoires
geneUsage(immdata$data[[1]]) %>% vis()  # Visualise the V-gene distribution for the first repertoire
repDiversity(immdata$data) %>% vis(.by = "Status", .meta = immdata$meta)  # Visualise the Chao1 diversity of repertoires, grouped by the patient status
```

### Use your own data

```r
library(immunarch)  # Load the package into R
immdata <- repLoad("path/to/your/data")  # Replace it with the path to your data. Immunarch automatically detects the file format.
```

### Advanced methods

For advanced methods such as clonotype annotation, clonotype tracking, k-mer analysis and public repertoire analysis see "Tutorials".


## Bugs and Issues

The mission of `immunarch` is to make bulk and single-cell immune repertoires analysis painless. All bug reports, documentation improvements, enhancements and ideas are appreciated. Just let us know via [GitHub](https://github.com/immunomind/immunarch/issues) (preferably) or [support@immunomind.io](mailto:support@immunomind.io) (in case of private data).

Bug reports must: 

1. Include a short, self-contained R snippet reproducing the problem. 
2. Add a minimal data sample for us to reproduce the problem. In case of sensitive data you can send it to [support@immunomind.io](mailto:support@immunomind.io) instead of GitHub issues.
3. Explain why the current behavior is wrong/not desired and what you expect instead.
4. If the issue is about visualisations, please attach a picture to the issue. In other case we wouldn't be able to reproduce the bug and fix it.


## Help the community

Aspiring to help the community build the ecosystem of scRNAseq & AIRR analysis tools? Found a bug? A typo? Would like to improve documentation, add a method or optimise an algorithm?

We are always open to contributions. There are two ways to contribute:

1. Create an issue [here](https://github.com/immunomind/immunarch/issues) and describe what would you like to improve or discuss.

2. Create an issue or find one [here](https://github.com/immunomind/immunarch/issues), fork the repository and make a pull request with the bugfix or improvement.
