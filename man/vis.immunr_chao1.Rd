\usage{
\method{vis}{immunr_chao1}(
  .data,
  .by = NA,
  .meta = NA,
  .errorbars = .errorbars,
  .errorbars.off = FALSE,
  .points = TRUE,
  .test = TRUE,
  .signif.label.size = .signif.label.size,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{Output from \code{\link{repDiversity}}.}

\item{.by}{Pass NA if you want to plot samples without grouping.

You can pass a character vector with one or several column names from ".meta"
to group your data before plotting. In this case you should provide ".meta".

You can pass a character vector that exactly matches the number of samples in
your data, each value should correspond to a sample's property. It will be used
to group data based on the values provided. Note that in this case you should
pass NA to ".meta".}

\item{.meta}{A metadata object. An R dataframe with sample names and their properties,
such as age, serostatus or hla.}

\item{.errorbars}{A numeric vector of length two with quantiles for error bars
on sectors. Disabled if ".errorbars.off" is TRUE.}

\item{.errorbars.off}{If TRUE then plot CI bars for distances between each group.
Disabled if no group passed to the ".by" argument.}

\item{.points}{A logical value defining whether points will be visualised or not.}

\item{.test}{A logical vector whether statistical tests should be applied. See "Details" for more information.}

\item{.signif.label.size}{An integer value defining the size of text for p-value.}

\item{...}{Not used here.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object.
}
\description{
An utility function to visualise the output from \code{\link{repDiversity}}.
}
\details{
If data is grouped, then statistical tests for comparing means of groups will be performed, unless \code{.test = FALSE} is supplied.
In case there are only two groups, the Wilcoxon rank sum test (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon_signed-rank_test) is performed
(R function \code{\link{wilcox.test}} with an argument \code{exact = FALSE}) for testing if there is a difference in mean rank values between two groups.
In case there more than two groups, the Kruskal-Wallis test (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%E2%80%93Wallis_one-way_analysis_of_variance) is performed (R function \code{\link{kruskal.test}}), that is equivalent to ANOVA for ranks and it tests whether samples from different groups originated from the same distribution.
A significant Kruskal-Wallis test indicates that at least one sample stochastically dominates one other sample.
Adjusted for multiple comparisons P-values are plotted on the top of groups.
P-value adjusting is done using the Holm method (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holm%E2%80%93Bonferroni_method) (also known as Holm-Bonferroni correction).
You can execute the command \code{?p.adjust} in the R console to see more.
